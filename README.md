# Project Sipsmart


∗ Engineered a feature-rich mobile application with 5 pages - login, signup, real-time alcoholic behavior monitoring, goal
tracking, and a personalized dashboard, showcasing strong engineering skills and a focus on user-centric solutions.
∗ Incorporated advanced location tracking using Google Places API, enhancing user safety by sending timely alerts every
30 minutes when detecting an alcoholic consumption environment.

In response to the growing concern surrounding alcohol consumption and its impact on individual well-being, we present a sophisticated mobile application developed using Xamarin Forms, a framework that seamlessly integrates XAML and C#. This innovative solution addresses multiple facets of the challenge by leveraging Azure SQL Database for robust user authentication, secure storage of signup details, and comprehensive management of user behavior data related to alcohol consumption.The user journey within the app is a carefully curated experience. It commences with an insightful behavior analysis, prompting users to reflect on their alcohol consumption patterns. Subsequently, users are encouraged to set personalized goals, fostering a sense of accountability and commitment. The dashboard, a central feature of the application, dynamically visualizes the intensity of a user's alcohol consumption, providing a clear and user-friendly representation of their progress over time.The utilization of Azure SQL Database extends beyond secure data storage for user details; it becomes an integral part of the goal-tracking mechanism. By storing and managing goal-related data, the app facilitates data-driven insights, empowering users to make informed decisions about their alcohol-related behaviors.In conclusion, our application is not merely a tool for tracking alcohol consumption; it is a holistic solution that combines secure authentication, behavior analysis, goal setting, and proactive location-based alerts. By embracing technology and thoughtful design, our app strives to create a supportive environment for individuals looking to make positive changes in their relationship with alcohol.
